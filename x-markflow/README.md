## Modern UI - Markflow
### Description
Markflow is an extension of Modern UI framework that provides a flexible API for parsing Markdown and converting it into
Spanned text, which is used by the framework's text layout engine to display on the screen.

Markflow uses `commonmark-java` as an API, supporting the CommonMark
specification along with some extensions.
